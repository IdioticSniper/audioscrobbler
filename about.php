	<h3>What is Audioscrobbler?</h3>
	<p>Audioscrobbler is a computer system made up of this website, thousands of users, and a plugin for whatever you use to play music on your computer. The concept is as simple as it is unique; every time you listen to a song on your computer, the plugin sends the name of that song to the Audioscrobbler server. </p>
	<p>With this information the Audioscrobbler server builds you a 'Musical Profile'. This means you can view statistics regarding your favourite artists and songs, as can other people. Similarly, you can browse through thousands of peoples Musical Profiles. The system also calculates which users are most similar to you, based on musical likes and dislikes, so you can take a look at what your peers are listening to.</p>
	<p>With profiles of so many people, it becomes possible to perform 'Collaborative Filtering' in order to generate personalized suggestions for new music. If you have ever used <a href="http://www.Amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon.com</a> you may have noticed that when you add an item to your basket, it tells you 'Customers who bought this, also bought X,Y,Z..'. Audioscrobbler is able to do one better that that; We can decipher 'People who listened to much of the same music as you also like the following bands: A,B,C'.</p>

	<h3>What do I have to do?</h3>
	<p>
		<ol>
			<li><a href="/signup.php">Register</a> to get your own username and profile.</li>
			<li><a href="/download.php">Download a plugin</a> for your music player. We have plugins for many Windows, Linux and Mac OS X Players.</li>

		</ol>
		Once you have installed the plugin, you simply ignore it and listen to music in the normal fashion.

After a few hundred songs the system will begin to match you to similar users, and generate suggestions for you.

	<h3>Why use Audioscrobbler?</h3>
	<p>The first benefit will be your personal Musical Profile, your own page on the website with graphs of which bands and songs you play the most. Many people find this remarkable - often people discover that the bands they actually play the most were not ones they considered their favourite.</p> 
	<p>After your profile contains a few hundred songs you will be presented with a list of users that have a similar taste in music to you. It is often interesting to browse the profile pages of these users, and see if there are any bands you don't recognise - the chances are that you may also like them.</p>
	<p>The next step is to receive personalized suggestions from the Audioscrobbler server. By comparing lots of peoples profiles it is possible to generate a list of artists that you may enjoy.</p>
